<h1 style="color:#ffffff;margin:0;">Daniel Bird</h1>
<p style="color:gray;">Kia Ora! üëã My name is Daniel. I am a full stack software developer with a passion for technology and building things with code and my hands. I started my journey as a technical writer in Singapore for a GPS company, then returned to Australia as an account manager of a software development company.</p>

<p style="color:gray;">After working for a number of companies both locally and overseas, I wanted more time with my family, so I started and have run a successful service business for the past 10 years in Auckland with my wife.</p>

<p style="color:gray;">I would continue to take every opportunity to keep up with the state of development and code during this time. The fulfilment I get from problem solving with code and seeing tangible results is something I have not found anywhere else. It became clear that software development and building things was where I wanted to be and where I felt I contributed the most.</p>

<p style="color:gray;">My core skills and passion is specifically <strong style="color:pink;"><ins>Javascript</ins></strong> with a focus on <strong style="color:pink;"><ins>React</ins></strong>, and now <strong style="color:pink;"><ins>Next.js.</ins></strong></p>

<p style="color:gray;">I recently decided to make the switch to software development as a full time job, and attended a software development course to be confident there were no gaps in my knowledge. I was one of the strongest technically, and used my prior knowledge to help others while also improving and solidifying my own knowledge and public speaking. I sincerely love learning new things, collaborating as part of a team and challenging myself.</p>

<p style="color:gray;">What sets me apart other than my technical ability, is my genuine care, honesty and proactiveness. I have the ability to look at challenges as opportunities, and I would love the opportunity to challenge myself and continue to improve both personally and professionally in a software development role.</p>
